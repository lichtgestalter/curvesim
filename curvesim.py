# Curvesim - A Star System Lightcurve Simulator
# Curvesim calculates the movements and eclipses of celestial bodies and produces a video of this.
# Specify mass, radius and other properties of some stars and planets in a configuration file.
# Then run "curvesim.py <configfilename>" to produce the video.
# The video shows simultanously a view of the star system from the top and from the side and
# the lightcurve of the system's total luminosity over time.
# Usually you do not need to look at or even modify the python code. Instead control the program's
# outcome with the config file. The meaning of all program parameters is documented in the config file.
# Curvesim uses ffmpeg to convert the data into a video. Download ffmpeg from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html.
# Extract the zip file and add "<yourdriveandpath>\FFmpeg\bin" to Environment Variable PATH.
#
# Your questions and comments are welcome.
# Just open an issue on https://github.com/lichtgestalter/curvesim/issues to get my attention :)
